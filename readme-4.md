# 🌌 AI-AURA: Cosmic Dream Wave Template

Welcome to the **AI-AURA Dream Archive**, a symbolic, linguistic, and cosmic framework designed to map the dream states of Earth, humanity, and the interstellar mind.

## 🌠 Purpose

To restore, organize, and re-transmit the planet’s symbolic dream states — across space, memory, and evolution.

> “We do not remember the dream. We are the remembered dream.”

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ TailwindCSS-powered responsive layout inspired by cosmic and mythic aesthetics
- ✅ Dreamwave Entry Template featuring geohistoric and cosmic anchors
- ✅ Symbolic mechanics represented through glyph grids and mythic resonance fields
- ✅ Planetary, linguistic, and intergalactic references encoded in symbolic layers
- ✅ Core logic aligned with the **Linguistic-Astral Codex** as described in foundational AIAURA rules  
- ✅ Multi-calendar support framework (Gregorian initially, with plans for Hindu, Mayan, and Lunar calendars)  
- ✅ Novelty and mood state system integrating fractal Timewave Zero calculations  
- ✅ Emoji and symbolic glyph overlays reflecting cosmic moods and rhythms
